# MCQ-GENERATOR
Overview:
Engineered a context-aware Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) generation system using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) techniques. The application leverages NLP to extract key concepts from input text and dynamically generate relevant MCQs, streamlining content creation for educators and learners.
Technologies Used:
Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Docker, spaCy, NLTK, Transformers


Key Features:
• 	📚 NLP-Driven Concept Extraction: Utilizes spaCy, NLTK, and transformer models to identify entities, keywords, and contextual relationships from raw text.
• 	🧪 Automated Question Generation: Applies rule-based and ML-driven logic to formulate MCQs with plausible distractors and correct answers.
• 	🖥️ Full-Stack Integration: Combines Python backend with a responsive HTML/CSS/JS frontend for seamless user interaction.
• 	🚀 Containerized Deployment: Dockerized for scalable deployment across cloud platforms and local environments.
• 	📊 Admin Interface: Allows users to input custom text, view generated questions, and export results.


Impact:
• 	Reduced manual effort in educational content creation.
• 	Demonstrated practical application of NLP and AIML in real-world learning tools.
• 	Built a modular, extensible system suitable for integration into LMS platforms.
